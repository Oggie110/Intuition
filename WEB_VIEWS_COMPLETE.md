  - Click to expand full email content inline

**3. Updated `base.html`**

## Your Use Case: ✅ SOLVED

> "Check director friend → see all our emails, SMS, etc., grouped by project"

**Now you can:**
1. Go to `/contacts`
2. Find your director friend
3. Click their name
4. See ALL communications organized like:

```
Project: Music Video Shoot
  - Email: "Re: Budget approval" (Jan 15)
  - Email: "Location scouting" (Jan 20)
  - WhatsApp: "Quick update" (Jan 22) [future]

Project: Documentary Film
  - Email: "Script feedback" (Dec 10)
  - SMS: "Great job!" (Dec 15) [future]
  - Email: "Distribution meeting" (Dec 20)
```

## Testing It Out

1. **Run the migration** (if not done yet):
   ```bash
   python -m project_manager.migrate --dry-run  # Preview
   python -m project_manager.migrate            # Execute
   ```

2. **Start the web server**:
   ```bash
   python -m project_manager.web
   ```

3. **Visit**:
   - `http://127.0.0.1:5000/contacts` - see all contacts
   - `http://127.0.0.1:5000/contacts/<id>` - see contact timeline grouped by project!

## What Happens Next

**When you fetch new emails:**
- Contacts are automatically extracted from senders
- Emails are stored as "communications"
- When you assign email to project, it links:
  - Communication → Project
  - Communication → Contact
  - Contact → Project

**Multi-dimensional queries now work:**
- Project view: "Show me everything for this project"
- Contact view: "Show me everything with this person (grouped by project)"

## Future: Multi-Platform

Once you add WhatsApp/Messenger/SMS integrations:
- Same workflow: fetch → assign to project → specify contact
- All show up in same timeline views
- Contact detail page shows ALL communication types
- All grouped by project automatically

## Architecture Benefits

**The beauty of the design:**
- Every communication has a `type` field ('email', 'whatsapp', etc.)
- Views don't care about type - they just display communications
- Adding new platforms = just new data sources, views stay the same
- Multi-dimensional pivoting works naturally (project ↔ contact)

**No CRM vendor lock-in:**
- All your data in SQLite
- Full control over schema
- Easy to export/backup
- Can add custom fields anytime
